# ============================================================================
# build_exe.ps1 -- build and SMOKE-TEST the ACE Windows release (PyInstaller).
#
# WHY THE SMOKE GATE EXISTS
#   A frozen build fails in ways a source run never shows: resource files that
#   were never bundled, hidden imports that only resolve at runtime, and code
#   that assumes sys.executable is a Python interpreter. Shipping an exe that
#   was never run is how you find those out from users. So this script will not
#   report success without running the packaged ace.exe through real checks.
#
# ASCII-ONLY ON PURPOSE. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less script as ANSI,
#   and this repository has been bitten by that more than once (CHANGELOG
#   v3.40.2, the REL-03 smoke script, and this very file once). Non-ASCII here
#   does not degrade gracefully: it turns into mojibake, which breaks quoting,
#   which breaks the whole parse. Keep every byte ASCII, comments included.
#
# USAGE
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File packaging/build_exe.ps1
#   ... -Python C:\path\to\python.exe   pick the interpreter to freeze with
#   ... -Python python                  a command name is fine too (Get-Command)
#   ... -Clean                          wipe build/ and dist/ first
#   ... -SkipSmoke                      build only (prints a loud warning)
#
# REQUIREMENTS
#   PyInstaller must be importable by the chosen interpreter:
#       <python> -m pip install pyinstaller
#   **requests must be installed too.** In a source run ace_net/ace_http import
#   requests lazily and degrade without it, so --mock works fine; but freezing
#   decides which modules get bundled AT BUILD TIME, and once frozen ace_net
#   requires requests with no fallback left in the vendor layer. Leave it out of
#   the build env and the --preview smoke fails looking like "missing requests"
#   rather than "the package is wrong", which is a confusing trail to follow.
#   Freezing with 3.10-3.12 is safer than 3.13 for third-party wheels, but the
#   core is pure stdlib so any 3.10+ should work.
#
# EXIT: 0 = built AND every smoke scenario passed. 1 = anything failed.

"""hooh_mcp.py -- frozen entry point for the self-contained MCP server.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The MCP pack (`packaging/mcp/`) used to ship **source only**: `ace-mcp.cmd` /
`ace-mcp.sh` look for `python3` on the host and bail out with exit 127 if it is
missing. That makes "attach HooH to Cline / Cursor / Claude Desktop" a task for
people who already have a Python toolchain -- the exact audience an MCP server
should NOT require that from.

This entry point exists so the pack can ship a **PyInstaller executable** that
carries its own interpreter. Same shape as the main build (`packaging/ace.spec`),
just aimed at the MCP door.

It adds NO logic of its own. The whole MCP path already exists and is shared:

    stdout swap -> build AgentCLI -> ai_code._run_mcp(cli, out)

That is what `ai_code.py --mcp` does. Duplicating any of it here would create a
second implementation to keep in sync, which is how the CLI and this server
would drift apart. The only thing this file owns is the *argument surface*: a
deliberate subset (see below), because a frozen server has no use for `--mock` /
`--tools` / `--install-ui` / REPL flags.

Argument surface (deliberately a subset)
----------------------------------------
    --project-root DIR      workspace the host's tool calls act on (default: cwd)
    --permission LEVEL      readonly | write | full            (default: readonly)
    --sandbox MODE          off | job | docker                 (default: off)
    --kb DIR                external knowledge base directory
    --skills DIR            file-based skills directory
    --approval-policy NAME  approval policy (see docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

Everything else stays configurable the normal way: `~/.ai_code.json`, project
`.ace/`, or environment variables -- `merge_config` handles all of them.

ASCII-only on purpose: this file is read on Windows by PyInstaller and this repo
has been burned twice by "BOM-less UTF-8 read as ANSI" (CHANGELOG v3.40.2,
REL-03). Comments in Chinese buy nothing here and cost risk.
